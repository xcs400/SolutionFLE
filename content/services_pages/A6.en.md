## Practice in real-life situations

Learning French also means experiencing the city and its culture.

### Beyond the classroom
We organize themed outings:
- Visits to local markets
- Cooking or tasting workshops
- Discovery of historical heritage

### Authentic practice
The aim is to use the language to order, ask for directions or chat with shopkeepers. An enriching and memorable experience.
